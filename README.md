# TaxiApp
Cab booking app is a mobile application that allows customers and taxi drivers to book rides. This software
uses a GPS technology to link customers and taxi drivers, allowing passengers to book a cab using their
smartphone. The app displays nearby taxis to his location to passengers. The primary goal of this project is to
make taxi services more feasible than they were previously. All you need is a smartphone and access to the
internet. If you are a passenger, you may request a taxi with only one click on the button. If youâ€™re a driver,
you may accept or deny requests with another click. Customers may easily book a car online, and cab booking
agencies can track their bookings online as well. Customers may see available cabs, view profiles, and book
cabs using this app. The majority of individuals rely on cab services for their everyday transportation
requirements. We can also check which cars are available for booking
